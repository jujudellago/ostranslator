# Zen Rails Base Application

## Summary
Base or "skeleton" application for Ruby on Rails 5.1 projects. Built to 
minimize the time spent writing boilerplate code and performing repetitive 
setup tasks. 

It comes with a preselected set of tools which I believe to be the most
efficient and widely used. If you are looking for greater flexibility, an
application template which uses Rails's templating system such as [Rails
Composer](http://www.railscomposer.com/) should be a better fit as it allows
the user to choose which templating engine, test framework, JS framework and
other tools to use.

Although this project is opinionated regarding tool choices, community 
feedback and contributions are always welcome and highly appreciated.

## Implementation
This app is meant to simply host the lit gem to handle translations for an external app
